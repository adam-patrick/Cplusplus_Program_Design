/*
Write a program that defines the named constant PI, const double
PI = 3.14159;, which stores the value of Ï€. The program should use
PI and the functions listed in Table 6-1 to accomplish the following:
a. Output the value of .
b. Prompt the user to input the value of a double variable r, which stores
the radius of a sphere. The program then outputs the following:
i. The value of 4.0r2, which is the surface area of the sphere.
ii. The value of (4.0/3.0)r3, which is the volume of the sphere.
